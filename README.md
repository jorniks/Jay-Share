Client to server file sharing web app.

The web app allows sharing of files via hotspot from client to server computer and from server to client computer. To run this web app on any computer, change the file path to suit the path of your computer. The file paths for sharing to server and accessing server by client are declared as variables for easy manipulation and ease of editing.
I created 5 folders for sorting of files in order of their formats namely Documents, Music, Videos, Pictures and Others; you can do the same or just use the parent directory which is titled Recieved to save files on the server computer.

Please give credit whenever and wherever this web app is used.
